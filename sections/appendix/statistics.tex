\subsection{Statistics}
\label{appendix:statistics}
% TODO: Add more statistics formulas, it needs more context beforehand. What this section does? For me its reminder and reference.

Discrete expectation:

\[ \mathbb{E}[X] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i p_i \]

Continuous expectation:

\[ \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx \]






\textbf{Marginal probability / marginal distribution}. Marginal distribution / probability is the probability distribution of a single variable (or a few variables). More intuitively, it is the probability of an event occurring without considering other events.



\textbf{Sharp distribution}. A sharp distribution is one that has most of its probability mass concentrated on a single point, or small number of points. This is the opposite of a \textbf{flat distribution} or \textbf{spread out distribution}, where the probability mass is more evenly distributed across many points.
