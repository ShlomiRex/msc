\subsection{U-Net: convolution, ReLU and max pooling}
\label{appendix:unet}

The U-Net is a CNN architecture and is widely adopted in diffusion models because of its denoising nature. It features a symmetric "U"-shaped structure with two main parts: a path that downsamples the input image and then upsamples it. Skip connections between corresponding layers in the downsampling and upsampling paths allow the network to combine both high-level and detailed spatial information, making it highly effective for tasks that require detailed output while retaining contextual understanding.
