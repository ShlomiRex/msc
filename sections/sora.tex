% TODO: Add more
Sora by OpenAI is a video synthesis model, if not one of the best video synthesis models to date. It was introduced in a 2023 paper \cite{sora}. The model is based on the principles of Stable Diffusion, Video-LDM and DiT. They leverage the scalability of the transformer architecture in DiT and use their already pre-trained GPT-4o model as the backbone (\cite{sun2024sora} section 3.1.2). The innovation in Sora is the use of diffusion, working in latent space, replacing U-Net with transformers, and the use of both adaptive layer norm and cross-attention for text conditioning.
