% TODO: Add more
Sora by OpenAI is a video synthesis model, if not one of the best video synthesis models to date. It was introduced in a 2023 and its implementation is closed-source (in addition OpenAI did not release the paper). The model is based on the principles of Stable Diffusion (section \ref{sec:stable_diffusion}), Video-LDM (section \ref{sec:videoldm}) and DiT (appendix \ref{appendix:diffusion_transformer}). They leverage the scalability of the transformer architecture in DiT and use their already pre-trained GPT-4o model as the backbone (\cite{sun2024sora} section 3.1.2). The innovation in Sora is the use of diffusion, working in latent space, replacing U-Net with transformers (DiT), and the use of both adaptive layer norm (appendix \ref{appendix:blocks_norm}) and cross-attention (appendix \ref{appendix:attention}) for text conditioning.
