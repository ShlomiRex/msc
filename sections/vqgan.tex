\section{VQ-GAN}
\label{sec:vqgan}

Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) \cite{vqgan} is a deep learning model capable of generating high-quality images, with the ability of conditioning (text, images, semantic masks and pose). The architecutre of VQ-GAN is based on previous works: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) \cite{vqvae}, transformers \cite{transformer}, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) \cite{gan}.
